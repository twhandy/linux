# Welcome to my knowledge base of Ubuntu Linux

<p>
  In this section, I will be highlighting my knowledge of Ubuntu Linux. 
</p>

<p>
  The information found here will cover basics into more advanced skills as I learn them; ranging from installing Ubuntu as a virtual machine to creating my own modded Minecraft server. You will find YouTube videos, accompanied with supplimental, hand crafted documentation, which showcase and explain each process, as well as any troubleshooting I performed.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you find my content easy to follow and hope each bit of information highlights my skills as a developing IT professional.
</p>

<p>
  Not much else to say other than I hope this is helpful to someone, as well as succeeding at my goal of learning the in's and out's of Ubuntu Linux.  Thanks for reading and enjoy!

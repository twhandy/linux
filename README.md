  The information found here will cover anything from basics, such as installing Linux as a virtual machines, to more advanced skills, such as creating automated scripts.

  Not much else to say other than I hope the information and tutorials found here are helpful to someone. I want to succeed at my goal of learning the in's and out's of Linux and sharing what I learn is one way I plan to achieve that goal.  Thanks for reading and enjoy!
